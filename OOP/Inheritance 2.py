"""
So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.

We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).

Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.

Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.

        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname

"""
# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):

"""
# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

# By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, 
# it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.
